### **Analysis Mode Selection**
Choose between two analysis types:

#### **Option A: Full Analysis (with biometric simulation)**
- Generates simulated biometric data
- Combines chronotype analysis with "live" signal data
- Shows detailed technical output
- Includes AI inference from Gemma

#### **Option B: Chrono-Signature Only (date-based)**
- Pure chronotype analysis based on birth date
- No biometric simulation
- Focuses on burnout timing and recovery strategies
- Provides personalized recommendations

## üìä Expected User Experience

### **For Full Analysis:**
```
üî¨ Full Chrono-Signature Analysis
üì° Signal Summary:
- Time: 2025-08-06 11:30:00 UTC
- EDA Level: 3.47 ¬µS
- Stimulus Classification: charged

üîç Chrono-Signature Profile
üìä Chrono-Signature Profile
Tags: creative, adaptive
Rationale:
- Based on chronotype analysis of birth date: [Your Birth Date]
- Chrono-signature identified: [Generated Signature]
- Element profile: {primary_element: "Metal", ...}
- Analysis uses scientifically-derived chronotype patterns

üìä Gemma Insight Summary
‚úÖ Your biometric rhythm aligns well with behavioral traits today.
üí° Maintain consistency in pacing and reinforce familiar habits.
```

### **For Chrono-Signature Only:**
```
üî¨ Pure Chrono-Signature Analysis

üîç Your Chrono-Signature Profile
Chrono-Signature: [Generated Signature]
Pattern Tags: creative, adaptive

Analysis Rationale:
‚Ä¢ Based on chronotype analysis of birth date: 15/05/1990
‚Ä¢ Chrono-signature identified: Geng-Yin
‚Ä¢ Element profile: Metal with Earth influence
‚Ä¢ Analysis uses scientifically-derived chronotype patterns

‚è∞ Burnout Risk Timing
‚úÖ Current Risk Level: Low
Next High-Risk Month: March 2026
Recovery Months: 6, 9, 12

üí° Personalized Recovery Strategies
Energy Management: Focus on sustained effort during morning hours
Stress Response: Use structured problem-solving approaches
Cognitive Style: Channel creative energy into systematic projects
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **If the app doesn't start:**
1. Make sure you're in the correct directory
2. Check that the virtual environment is activated
3. Try: `python -m streamlit run app\main.py`

### **If you see import errors:**
1. Activate the virtual environment first
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### **If Ollama integration fails:**
- The app will automatically fall back to simulation mode
- You'll still get full functionality, just without real AI inference

## üéØ User Testing Scenarios

Try these scenarios to test the application:

### **Scenario 1: Happy Path - Full Analysis**
1. Click "I agree" and proceed
2. Fill out all fields:
   - Nickname: "Alex"
   - DOB: Pick a date from the 1990s
   - Location: "Kuala Lumpur"
   - Status: "Working"
3. Select 2-3 symptoms (e.g., "Feeling tired", "Difficulty concentrating")
4. Choose "Full Analysis (with biometric simulation)"
5. Click "Analyze"

**Expected Results:**
- Should see simulated biometric data (EDA levels, environmental state)
- Chrono-signature profile with pattern tags
- AI-generated insights and recommendations
- Technical details section with signal ID

### **Scenario 2: Chrono-Only Mode**
1. Use different data:
   - Nickname: "Maria"
   - DOB: Different date (try 1985 or 2000)
   - Location: "Singapore"
   - Status: "Student"
2. Don't select any symptoms
3. Choose "Chrono-Signature Only (date-based)"
4. Click "Analyze"

**Expected Results:**
- Pure chronotype analysis without biometrics
- Burnout risk timing (current risk level, high-risk months)
- Recovery strategies tailored to chronotype
- No biometric simulation data

### **Scenario 3: Edge Cases**
- **Recent birth dates**: Try 2005 (younger user)
- **Older birth dates**: Try 1970 (older user)
- **All symptoms selected**: Test with all 7 symptoms checked
- **No symptoms**: Test with zero symptoms selected
- **Different locations**: Try various cities

### **Scenario 4: System Status Testing**
- Check the status indicators on Page 1:
  - Look for Ollama status (likely shows simulation mode)
  - Verify the privacy notice appears
  - Test that "Proceed" only works after agreeing

### **Scenario 5: Data Persistence Testing**
1. Run analysis once with Full Mode
2. Run again with Chrono-Only mode
3. Check if the system handles multiple analyses properly

## üîç What to Look For During Testing

### ‚úÖ **Positive Indicators:**
- Smooth page transitions
- Consistent chronotype results for same birth date
- Reasonable biometric values (0.5-6.0 ¬µS for EDA)
- Coherent AI recommendations
- Proper error handling
- Clear, readable output formatting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Red Flags to Report:**
- Application crashes or freezes
- Blank or error pages
- Inconsistent results for same input
- Missing UI elements
- Unreadable text or formatting issues

## üîó **Additional Resources**

- **README.md**: General project overview and setup instructions
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Technical system architecture documentation  
- **setup_gemma.md**: Ollama/Gemma installation guide
- **requirements.txt**: Python package dependencies

## üìß **Support**

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Verify your Python version is 3.8+
3. Ensure virtual environment is activated
4. Try running in simulation mode if Ollama issues occur

*This guide is designed to help users quickly get started with GemmaGuard's wellness monitoring capabilities.*
- Inconsistent results for same input
- Unrealistic biometric values
- Broken formatting or missing data
- Import errors in console

### üìä **Data Quality Checks:**
- Chrono-signatures should be consistent for same birth date
- Pattern tags should make sense (e.g., "creative", "adaptive")
- Burnout timing should vary by birth date
- Recovery strategies should match chronotype
- AI insights should be relevant to selected symptoms

## üéÆ Interactive Features to Test

### **Page 1 Features:**
- [ ] Privacy checkbox must be checked to proceed
- [ ] Ollama status indicator updates correctly
- [ ] Page navigation works smoothly

### **Page 2 Features:**
- [ ] All form fields accept input properly
- [ ] Date picker works correctly
- [ ] Radio buttons for analysis mode work
- [ ] Symptom checkboxes can be selected/deselected
- [ ] "Analyze" button triggers processing

### **Results Display:**
- [ ] Biometric data displays properly (Full Analysis)
- [ ] Chronotype profile shows correctly
- [ ] AI insights are readable and relevant
- [ ] Technical details expand properly
- [ ] Burnout timing displays correctly (Chrono-Only)

The application should handle all these scenarios gracefully and provide meaningful insights in each case.
