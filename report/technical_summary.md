# GemmaGuard Technical Summary

## Executive Overview

GemmaGuard is a sophisticated wellness monitoring application that leverages temporal pattern analysis, biometric simulation, and AI-powered insights to provide personalized stress and burnout detection. The system employs a dual-mode architecture offering users both comprehensive biometric analysis (Full Analysis with simulated skin conductance data) and focused behavioral pattern assessment (Temporal Pattern Analysis using birth date only). The application demonstrates clear Gemma integration (supporting multiple Gemma model versions including Gemma 3n) while maintaining commercial viability through selective algorithm disclosure.
